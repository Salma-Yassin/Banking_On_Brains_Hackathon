##  Problem Description 

- Fraudsters apply for new bank accounts with attractive pre-approved benefits including loan facilities and credit cards which allow funds to be withdrawn quickly.

- However, the fraudsters opening these accounts have no intention of repayment.

- They apply using synthetic identities; this involves using a mix of legitimate and fraudulent information. Some represent stolen personal data from real consumers, and some are fabricated by fraudsters.

## Implementation

#### Data Exploration and Cleaning:
In-depth analysis of loan features using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques. Comprehensive data cleaning procedures to address missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.
#### Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:
Unveil relationships between individual features and the target variable (loan approval status). Investigate interactions between loan features using correlation analysis or visualization methods.
#### K-Means Clustering:
Group loan applications into distinct clusters based on loan characteristics. Analyze cluster composition and identify potential patterns associated with high-risk or low-risk loans.
#### Model Building and Evaluation:
Implemented multiple supervised machine learning including Random Forest, KNN, and Logistic Regression, and used cross-validation to decide on the best model to use.
#### MOdel Evaluation:
